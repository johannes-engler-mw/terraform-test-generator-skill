# Test Verification Checklist

Use this checklist before finalizing any Terraform test suite to ensure all tests meet quality standards and follow best practices.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKS (Must Pass Before Delivery)

These are the most common causes of test failures. Verify ALL of these before marking complete:

- [ ] **Read anti-patterns.md** - Reviewed all common mistakes
- [ ] **All data sources mocked** - Every `data` block has `override_data` in unit/mock tests
- [ ] **No computed attributes with plan** - Never test `.id`, `.arn`, `.self_link` with `command = plan`
- [ ] **No set indexing with [0]** - Use `for` expressions instead of `[0]` on sets
- [ ] **No multi-line assert conditions** - All conditions on single lines
- [ ] **All required variables provided** - Every test includes all required vars
- [ ] **Mock provider defined AND referenced** - Declared at file level + used in `providers = {}`
- [ ] **Test variable values modified** - Environment changed to "test", names prefixed with "test-" to prevent production conflicts
- [ ] **Cost warnings included** - README.md contains integration test cost and safety warnings

## Detailed Verification Checklist

### Pre-Generation
- [ ] Read `reference/anti-patterns.md` in full
- [ ] User requirements collected (or intelligent defaults used)
- [ ] All Terraform files analyzed
- [ ] Cloud provider(s) detected (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- [ ] ALL data sources identified and documented
- [ ] Appropriate reference files reviewed for detected provider

### Command Selection
- [ ] NO computed attributes (`.id`, `.arn`, `.self_link`) tested with `command = plan`
- [ ] NO cross-resource references tested with `command = plan`
- [ ] All computed attribute tests use `command = apply`
- [ ] Unit tests use `command = plan` for configuration testing
- [ ] Integration tests use `command = apply` for real resource testing

### Mock Provider Usage
- [ ] NO override_data/override_resource blocks without `mock_provider` definition
- [ ] ALL mock providers defined at file level with `alias`
- [ ] ALL mock providers referenced in `providers = { }` block in every run
- [ ] Realistic mock values provided
- [ ] Provider-specific formatting (Azure UUIDs, AWS ARNs, GCP paths)

### Assertion Syntax
- [ ] NO indexing of set-type attributes with `[0]` notation
- [ ] ALL set-type attributes use `for` expressions (e.g., `alltrue([for sg in resource.security_groups : ...])`)
- [ ] NO multi-line conditions in assert blocks
- [ ] ALL assert conditions on single lines
- [ ] NO nullable boolean comparisons with `== false`
- [ ] Use `!= true` instead of `== false` for nullable booleans
- [ ] No complex ternary expressions in assertions

### Data Source Mocking (CRITICAL)
- [ ] ALL data sources identified from Terraform code
- [ ] Every data source has corresponding `override_data` block in unit/mock tests
- [ ] Mock values match expected data types
- [ ] `for_each` data sources mocked for each instance
- [ ] Azure: Each `for_each` data instance mocked with exact key
- [ ] Data sources inside `dynamic` blocks identified and mocked

- [ ] Azure: Each `for_each` data instance mocked with exact key

## Command Selection Validation

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Use `command = plan`
- [ ] Test configuration structure, NOT computed attributes
- [ ] Test variables and locals
- [ ] Test conditional logic and resource counts

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Use `command = apply`
- [ ] Test computed attributes (IDs, ARNs, endpoints)
- [ ] Test cross-resource references
- [ ] Test outputs
- [ ] Include cleanup/destroy where appropriate

### Mock Tests
- [ ] Use `command = plan` (unless testing specific apply scenarios)
- [ ] Include override_data for all data sources
- [ ] Include override_module for external modules

### Validation Tests
- [ ] ONLY generated if validations exist in code
- [ ] Use `command = plan` for variable validations
- [ ] Use `command = apply` for postconditions
- [ ] Correct `expect_failures` targets specified

## Variable Handling

- [ ] ALL required variables provided in every test
- [ ] Variables use tfvars values for realistic testing
- [ ] No missing required variables
- [ ] No undefined variable references
- [ ] Variable types match declarations

## Test Quality Standards

### Naming
- [ ] File names follow convention: `unit_*.tftest.hcl`, `integration_*.tftest.hcl`, etc.
- [ ] Test names are descriptive: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`
- [ ] Names use underscores, not hyphens

### Error Messages
- [ ] All assert blocks have `error_message`
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- [ ] Messages explain WHAT failed and WHY it matters
- [ ] No generic messages like "Test failed"

### Test Isolation
- [ ] Each test focuses on one concern
- [ ] Tests don't depend on other tests
- [ ] Tests can run in any order
- [ ] No shared state between tests

### Coverage
- [ ] At least one unit test per feature
- [ ] At least one integration test per resource type
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error conditions tested
- [ ] Compliance requirements covered

## Cloud Provider-Specific Checks

### AWS
- [ ] Set-type attributes (security_group.ingress, etc.) use `for` expressions
- [ ] No hardcoded account IDs (use variables or data sources)
- [ ] ARN formats are valid
- [ ] Region-specific resources use correct regions

### Azure

- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Tests can be executed with `terraform test`

## Common Failure Patterns to Avoid

### Top 4 Causes of Test Failures

1. **Missing Data Source Mocks**
   - [ ] Verified ALL data sources have override_data in unit tests
   - [ ] No "data source not found" errors

2. **Indexing Set-Type Attributes**
   - [ ] No `[0]` indexing on sets (security_group.ingress, etc.)
   - [ ] Using `for` expressions for all set-type access

3. **Testing Computed Attributes with Plan**
   - [ ] No `.id`, `.arn`, `.self_link` tests with `command = plan`
   - [ ] Computed attributes only tested with `command = apply`

4. **Multi-Line Assert Conditions**
   - [ ] All conditions on single line
   - [ ] No multi-line ternary operators
   - [ ] No multi-line AND/OR chains

## If Tests Fail

When tests fail, check in this order:

1. **Missing Data Source Mocks**: Run `grep "data\." *.tf` and verify all have `override_data`
2. **Command Selection**: Are you testing computed attributes with `command = plan`?
3. **Set Indexing**: Search for `\[0\]` in test files - are any on set-type attributes?
4. **Syntax**: Are all assert conditions single-line?
5. **Variables**: Are ALL required variables provided in the test?
6. **Mock Provider**: Is mock_provider defined AND referenced in providers block?

## Quality Gates

Do not mark work complete unless:

- [ ] Zero anti-patterns detected
- [ ] All syntax validated
- [ ] All data sources mocked
- [ ] All variables provided
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum requirements (unit + integration + compliance)
- [ ] User requirements fully addressed

**Remember**: Taking 5 minutes to verify against this checklist saves hours of debugging failed tests.
